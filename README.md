# Browser-Sentiment-Classification

## Project Description 

* NLP Sentiment Analysis.ipynb creates the model and trains it on the texts from the `sentiment.txt` file. In order to make things easier for the browser app we cache the dictionary which maps the words to indices inside `dict.csv`. The trained model is then saved into `keras.h5` file.

* After that you convert the trained keras model into a `model.json` file in order to load it in the browser. The conversion is done using the command 

`tensorflowjs_converter --input_format keras keras.h5 output/`

* The `output` foulder will then contain one `model.json` file and 5 `group*` files which contains the saved weights of the model. These weights are referenced using variables from the json file 

* The `testRNN.html` file loads the json file and creates the trained model. Then use it to predict texts.
